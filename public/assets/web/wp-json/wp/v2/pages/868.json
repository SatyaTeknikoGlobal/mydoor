You can enable\/disable elements in theme option &#8211; Header and menu options (available also in Customizer). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to enable registration, go to Settings &#8211; general and enable &#8220;Anyone can register&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1346\" height=\"846\" src=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Image-2020-01-06-at-11.10.03-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-878\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then go to Theme option &#8211; user option and remove link from &#8220;Custom register link&#8221;. Now, your users can register from LoginRegister button in header. You can also use custom link for user registration page. For example, if you have Buddypress on site, your register link can be \/register <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you use Buddypress, but still want to register users from popup, make sure that you enabled Synchronization between login popup and BP in theme option &#8211; Buddypress option<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t need registration, just remove button from header and disable registration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rehubdocs.wpsoul.com\/docs\/rehub-theme\/user-submit-memberships-profiles\/setup-user-login-and-register-popup-menus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"More about Login popup (opens in a new tab)\">More about Login popup<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>User Profiles and Buddypress<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to have cashback site &#8211; you must enable advanced User Profiles which will be place where users can see their basic info, change logo, see their cashbacks. So, you must install free Buddypress plugin. After installation, go to Settings &#8211; Buddypress &#8211; Components. If you need just Cashback and user profiles, keep active only Extended profiles and Account settings + maybe Notifications and disable all other components<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1168\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Image-2020-01-05-at-10.03.08-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-869\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Point system and cashback<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need cashback or any other Reputation based features like badges, levels, reputation, install Mycred plugin. It&#8217;s free plugin. If you don&#8217;t need cashbacks and points on site, go to theme option &#8211; Buddypress option &#8211; <strong>custom message or html in profile of User<\/strong> and remove everything from this field. Or setup it according to your needs, more information can be found in article <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"about cashback (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/wpsoul.com\/how-to-make-cashback-site-on-wordpress-and-rehub-theme\/\" target=\"_blank\">about cashback<\/a> settings on our blog. Also delete Cashback Profile page from Pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please, note.

You can use any other Form Submit plugin for this purpose, but RH frontend plugin is plugin of our team and it&#8217;s more Offer\/Deal sumbit plugin because it has option for automatic Image\/Price parsing (it&#8217;s not working for any offers, but for near 75% of urls)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t need user submit feature and you used Demo import, go to Theme option &#8211; User Option and remove Add and Edit Post submit urls and labels from options.
