Individually no single feature is a massive leap forward in the action cam industry, but collectively they represent a notable and substantial difference over the Hero4 Black.&nbsp; This section is mostly focused on these new features, while the remaining sections take a deeper dive into the core functions of the camera, as well as touch on these new features in more detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully Waterproofed: Probably the most notable item is that the GoPro Hero5 Black is now fully waterproofed without the need for a separate case, just like the GoPro Hero4 Session was.&nbsp; In fact, it has nearly the same rubberish material on the outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is of more concern though is the USB-C\/HDMI port door.&nbsp; This door pops off for placement into the Karma gimbal\/drone, as well as just for charging:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deals<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wpsm-titlebox clearbox wpsm_style_1\"><strong class=\"\">Example for deal list from other blocks<\/strong><div>            <div class=\"clearfix\"><\/div>\r\n                                                    \t\r\n\r\n\t                                <div class=\"rh_list_builder rh-shadow4 disablemobileshadow mb25\">\r\n            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \t     \r\n                <div class=\"top_table_list_item border-lightgrey whitebg\"> \r\n                <div class=\"rh-flex-eq-height mobileblockdisplay\">                   \r\n\t\t            <div class=\"listbuild_image border-right listitem_column text-center rh-flex-center-align position-relative pt15 pb15 pr20 pl20\">\r\n\t            \t\t<div class=\"colored_rate_bar abdposright mt15 mr15\">\r\n\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t        <\/div>\r\n\t\t                <figure class=\"position-relative margincenter\">\r\n\t\t                    <a class=\"img-centered-flex rh-flex-center-align rh-flex-justify-center\" href=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/panasonic-portable-oral-irrigatordental-water-flosser\/\">\r\n\t\t                            \r\n\t\t                    <img src=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/thumbs_dir\/4093058.attach-1wzvitivj7hlaqrlqmd1754qa2objb8rel7lq4b6xuhg.jpg\" height=\"126\" alt=\"Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator\/Dental Water Flosser\" \/> \r\n\t\t                    <\/a> \r\n\t\t                <\/figure>                              \r\n\t\t            <\/div>                            \r\n\t                <div class=\"rh-flex-grow1 border-right listitem_title listitem_column pt15 pb15 pr20 pl20\">\r\n\t                    <h3 class=\"font120 mb10 mt0 list_heading fontbold\"><a href=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/panasonic-portable-oral-irrigatordental-water-flosser\/\">Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator\/Dental Water Flosser<\/a><span class=\"blockstyle\"><span class=\"re-line-badge re-line-small-label badge_2\"><span>Best seller<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\t                    <div class=\"lineheight20\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPanasonic.com has their Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator\/Dental Water Flosser (EW-DJ10-A) for $49.99 &#8211;

And from the left you can access the playback pages to review photos and videos you\u2019ve taken.&nbsp; I cover all this in-detail in this video below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-color is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n<div class=\"wpsm_box yellow_type nonefloat_box mb30\" style=\"text-align:left; width:auto\"><i><\/i><div>\n\t\t\tAll of this is of course waterproof as well.\u00a0 Though, it won\u2019t work underwater.\u00a0 For that you\u2019ll need to use the push-buttons on the top\/side of the camera to change modes. Box Content\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-color is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of a wet display, in general I found it doesn\u2019t work well when wet either.&nbsp; Especially if your fingers are wet, it all goes to crap and fails to respond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said earlier, in theory the new GoPro Hero5 Black touch display layout looks good, but in practice it needs a bit more refinement.&nbsp; I found that the vast majority of the time while trying to change modes the slight display lag combined with tiny option selectors meant many missed attempts at configuring things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Voice Control:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the VIRB Ultra 30, GoPro too introduced Voice Control this fall.&nbsp; This means you can simply tell your camera \u201cGoPro, Start Recording\u201d, and it\u2019ll indeed start recording.&nbsp; Same goes for photos, and even changing modes.&nbsp; In fact, you can actually swear an expletive that rhymes with \u2018hit\u2019 and it\u2019ll mark a highlight there.&nbsp; It\u2019s cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" src=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/gopro2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-842\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn this option on\/off, and it\u2019s available in seven languages.&nbsp; Also, if you have the Remo accessory remote, that\u2019ll accept voice commands too in the event the camera is out of range of your voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\u2026it\u2019s not perfect.&nbsp; I found that it works most of the time when standing still.&nbsp; But once you start moving I found both it and the Hero5 Session actually perform worse than Garmin does.&nbsp; At about 10MPH (15KPH) I find the ability to give commands pretty much dies no matter which way the camera is facing.&nbsp; Whereas with Garmin it\u2019ll continue working above that speed as long as the camera is facing you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\u2019ll see that GoPro has more functionality (commands) than Garmin does.&nbsp; And earlier leaked manuals in August even showed GoPro being able to learn new commands you assign it (that hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2026but that\u2019d be super cool).&nbsp; But in usage, the Garmin actually works better when you start moving, and there\u2019s fewer failed commands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GPS &amp; Sensors:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hero5 Black contains GPS.&nbsp; But that GPS won\u2019t do anything for you.&nbsp; See, the GPS on the Hero5 Black is merely used to geotag the location of your photos and videos.&nbsp; Essentially it does what Facebook and Instagram do with your phone by saying \u2018You were here\u2019 when you took this photo.&nbsp; It is NOT used to record your GPS tracks while you bike\/ski\/surf\/etc\u2026 Nor is it used to display your speed on videos.&nbsp; Basically, it\u2019s not used for much of anything except saying \u201cThis was taken in NYC\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is obviously a huge disappointment for sports fans that wanted to overlay data like speed or distance onto their videos and have that all be done natively within the GoPro suite.&nbsp; After all, GoPro bought Dashware, the leading app for overlaying such metrics.&nbsp; Yet, tough beans for any usage there at this point.&nbsp; The GPS tagging icon is shown at the top left of the display:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/gopro3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-843\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic Image Stabilization, RAW Photos, Advanced Audio Tracks: I\u2019m bucketing all three of these together, not because they deserve to be together, but because I want to call them out here before I dive into them more deeply down below.&nbsp; These are in many ways some of the biggest differences between the Hero5 Black and Hero5 Session.&nbsp; While the Hero5 Session does have stabilization, it does not have the new RAW photo mode, nor does it have the Advanced Audio Track capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, let\u2019s talk audio and video modes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video &amp; Audio details<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahh yes, video time.&nbsp; No better place to start diving into features than video modes.&nbsp; In many ways the Hero5 is similar in these modes to the Hero4 Black.&nbsp; After all, it too has 4K @ 30FPS and 720P @ 240FPS, the two ends of the spectrum that people often talk about.&nbsp; The footage looks beautiful in 4K \u2013 no doubt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GoPro HERO5 IN-DEPTH!

Note that this photo timelapse is separate from the video timelapse option.&nbsp; This produces a crapton of photo files, whereas the video timelapse produces a single video timelapse file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the photo mode you can change resolution, as well as perspective.&nbsp; Resolution is set to 12MP.&nbsp; While perspective options are Wide, Linear, Medium, and Narrow.&nbsp; The linear one is the most notable new one, which aims to reduce the fisheye effect seen on many action cams.&nbsp; To understand these differences, here\u2019s a sample gallery of the different modes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The burst mode allows you to capture a moment of action with up to 30 frames per second.&nbsp; You can also configure it to have those frames spread out over a few seconds too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HERO5 BLACK VS HERO5 SESSION:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\u2019re trying to choose between the Hero5 Black and the Hero5 Session.&nbsp; Both solid choices, and let me give you some food for thought on deciding between the two (the next section I talk about between the Hero5 Black vs the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30).&nbsp; Do note I\u2019m specifically talking here about the $299USD Hero5 Session, and *NOT* the cheaper $199 Hero Session, which lacks a ton of features compared to the $299 Hero5 Session.&nbsp; The key visible difference being the lack of the numeral \u20185\u2019 in the Hero Session name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a top-line standpoint, here\u2019s what the Hero5 Black has that the Hero5 Session lacks:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wpsm_checklist wpsm_pretty_list wpsm_pretty_hover\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>12MP instead of 10MP pictures on Session<\/li>\n<li>GPS for location stamping<\/li>\n<li>Inability to swap out battery (it\u2019s not removable)<\/li>\n<li>RAW photo option<\/li>\n<li>WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) photo option<\/li>\n<li>Higher slow-mo specs (240fps on Black vs 120fps on Session)<\/li>\n<li>A handful less frame-rate options<\/li>\n<li>Touch display on the back (no display at all)<\/li>\n<li>Three mics vs two mics on Hero5 Session<\/li>\n<li>Ability to record individual audio streams<\/li>\n<li>HDMI port for direct viewing\/connection options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019ll still get all this stuff on the Hero5 Session though:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wpsm_checklist wpsm_pretty_list wpsm_pretty_hover\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2013 Voice control<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Electronic Image Stabilization<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 WiFi Uploads to GoPro Plus<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 4K Video options<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Karma Drone and Karma Grip Compatibility ($29 accessory required)<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 Waterproofing to 10m\/33ft<\/li>\n<li>\u2013 USB-C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the basic differences. Again, both cameras are very good, you won\u2019t go wrong with either.&nbsp; For me, I prefer the Hero5 Black because I like to be able to see and frame up what I\u2019m taking a photo\/video of.&nbsp; Whereas the Hero5 Session it\u2019s shoot and pray that you\u2019ve got it lined up.&nbsp; Sure, you can use your phone for certain shots \u2013 but most of us won\u2019t do that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While the GoPro Hero5 has many of the same specs as the previous generation when it comes to video and photo resolutions, there are some new features in it.&nbsp; Individually no single feature is a massive leap forward in the action cam industry, but collectively they represent a notable and substantial difference over the Hero4 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":845,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"blog_tag":[],"blog_category":[52],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog\/826"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/blog"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=826"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog\/826\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1082,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog\/826\/revisions\/1082"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/845"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=826"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"blog_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog_tag?post=826"},{"taxonomy":"blog_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/redeal.lookmetrics.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog_category?post=826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
